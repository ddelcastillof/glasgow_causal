                  diabetes--may not be possible using standard analytic
                  techniques. The parametric g-formula, which appropriately
                  adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior
                  exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects
                  when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint
                  interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions
                  that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors
                  (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula,
                  and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical
                  lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the

                  moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the

                  distribution of potential outcomes under arbitrary treatment
                  regimes. Like g-estimation of structural nested models and
                  inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models,
                  the parametric g-formula can appropriately adjust for measured
                  time-varying confounders that are affected by prior treatment.
                  However, there have been few implementations of the parametric
                  g-formula to date. Here, we apply the parametric g-formula to
                  assess the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy on
                  time to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death in
                  two US-based human immunodeficiency virus cohorts including
                  1498 participants. These participants contributed
                  approximately 7300 person-years of follow-up (49\% exposed to
                  highly active antiretroviral therapy) during which 382 events
                  occurred and 259 participants were censored because of
                  dropout. Using the parametric g-formula, we estimated that
                  antiretroviral therapy substantially reduces the hazard of
                  AIDS or death (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95\% confidence limits
                  [CL]: 0.42, 0.71). This estimate was similar to one previously
                  reported using a marginal structural model, 0.54 (95\% CL:
                  0.38, 0.78). The 6.5-year difference in risk of AIDS or death
                  was 13\% (95\% CL: 8\%, 18\%). Results were robust to
                  assumptions about temporal ordering, and extent of history
                  modeled, for time-varying covariates. The parametric g-formula
                  is a viable alternative to inverse probability weighting of
                  marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural
                  nested models for the analysis of complex longitudinal data.},

                  the effect of a policy, intervention, or treatment. Unlike
                  standard regression approaches, the parametric g-formula can
                  be used to adjust for time-varying confounders that are
                  affected by prior exposures. To date, there are few published
                  examples in which the method has been applied. METHODS: We
                  provide a simple introduction to the parametric g-formula and
                  illustrate its application in an analysis of a small cohort
                  study of bone marrow transplant patients in which the effect
                  of treatment on mortality is subject to time-varying
                  confounding. RESULTS: Standard regression adjustment yields a
                  biased estimate of the effect of treatment on mortality
                  relative to the estimate obtained by the g-formula.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The g-formula allows estimation of a relevant
                  parameter for public health officials: the change in the
                  hazard of mortality under a hypothetical intervention, such as
                  reduction of exposure to a harmful agent or introduction of a
                  beneficial new treatment. We present a simple approach to
                  implement the parametric g-formula that is sufficiently
                  general to allow easy adaptation to many settings of public
                  health relevance.},

                  periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not
                  uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of
                  subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality
                  studies date of termination of employment is both a
                  determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals
                  receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor
                  for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave
                  employment). When current risk factor status determines
                  subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure,
                  standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates
                  as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the
                  true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one
                  adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation
                  raises the question, which if any population parameters can be
                  given a causal interpretation in observational mortality
                  studies?In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the
                  identification and computation of causal parameters in
                  mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This
                  approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the
                  observational study is identified with a hypothetical
                  double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's
                  assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data
                  file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing
                  mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a
                  double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment
                  protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol
                  can still be estimated.We reanalyze the mortality experience
                  of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our
                  method and compare our results with those obtained using
                  standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic
                  exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard
                  methods fail to detect.},

                  weighting) can be used to adjust for measured confounding and
                  selection bias under the four assumptions of consistency,
                  exchangeability, positivity, and no misspecification of the
                  model used to estimate weights. In recent years, several
                  published estimates of the effect of time-varying exposures
                  have been based on weighted estimation of the parameters of
                  marginal structural models because, unlike standard
                  statistical methods, weighting can appropriately adjust for
                  measured time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure.
                  As an example, the authors describe the last three assumptions
                  using the change in viral load due to initiation of
                  antiretroviral therapy among 918 human immunodeficiency
                  virus-infected US men and women followed for a median of 5.8
                  years between 1996 and 2005. The authors describe possible
                  tradeoffs that an epidemiologist may encounter when attempting
                  to make inferences. For instance, a tradeoff between bias and
                  precision is illustrated as a function of the extent to which
                  confounding is controlled. Weight truncation is presented as
                  an informal and easily implemented method to deal with these
                  tradeoffs. Inverse probability weighting provides a powerful
                  methodological tool that may uncover causal effects of
                  exposures that are otherwise obscured. However, as with all
                  methods, diagnostics and sensitivity analyses are essential
                  for proper use.},

                  probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances,
                  instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal
                  inference model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent
                  when either a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or
                  a model for the distribution of the counterfactual data is
                  correctly specified. Because with observational data one can
                  never be sure that a model for the treatment assignment
                  mechanism or a model for the counterfactual data is correct,
                  inference based on DR estimators should improve upon previous
                  approaches. Indeed, we present the results of simulation
                  studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance
                  of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict. The
                  proposed method is applied to a cardiovascular clinical trial.},

                  association between income and health, but estimates of the
                  causal effects of income vary substantially. Different
                  definitions of income may lead to substantially different
                  empirical results, yet research is often framed as
                  investigating "the effect of income" as if it were a single,
                  easily definable construct. METHODS/RESULTS: The aim of this
                  paper is to introduce a taxonomy for definitional and
                  conceptual issues in studying individual- or household-level
                  income for health research. We focus on (1) the definition of
                  the income measure (earned and unearned; net, gross, and
                  disposable; real and nominal; individual and household;
                  relative and absolute income) and (2) the definition of the
                  causal contrast (amount, functional form
                  assumptions/transformations, direction, duration of change,
                  and timing of exposure and follow-up). We illustrate the
                  application of the taxonomy to four examples from the
                  published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Quantified estimates of
                  causal effects of income on health and wellbeing have crucial
                  relevance for policymakers to anticipate the consequences of
                  policies targeting the social determinants of health. However,
                  much prior evidence has been limited by lack of clarity in
                  distinguishing between different causal questions. The present
                  framework can help researchers explicitly and precisely
                  articulate income-related exposures and causal questions.},

                  households do less well than their peers on a range of
                  developmental outcomes. However, there is continuing
                  uncertainty about how far money itself matters, and how far
                  associations simply reflect other, unobserved, differences
                  between richer and poorer families. The authors conducted a
                  systematic review of studies using methods that lend
                  themselves to causal interpretation. To be included, studies
                  had to use Randomised Controlled Trials, quasi-experiments or
                  fixed effect-style techniques on longitudinal data. The
                  results lend strong support to the hypothesis that household
                  income has a positive causal effect on children’s outcomes,
                  including their cognitive and social-behavioural development
                  and their health, particularly in households with low income
                  to begin with. There is also clear evidence of a positive
                  causal effect of income on ‘intermediate outcomes’ that are
                  important for children’s development, including maternal
                  mental health, parenting and the home environment. The review
                  also makes a methodological contribution, identifying that
                  effects tend to be larger in experimental and
                  quasi-experimental studies than in fixed effect approaches.
                  This finding has implications for our ability to generalise
                  from observational studies.},

                  confounding and health selection (the reverse pathway from
                  health to income). This paper reports results of a systematic
                  review of panel and longitudinal studies investigating whether
                  changes in income led to changes in self-rated health (SRH) in
                  adults. A variety of electronic databases were searched, up
                  until January 2010, and thirteen studies were included, using
                  data from five different panel or longitudinal studies. The
                  majority of studies found a small, positive and statistically
                  significant association of income with SRH, which was much
                  reduced after controlling for unmeasured confounders and/or
                  health selection. Residual bias, particularly from measurement
                  error, probably reduced this association to the null. Most
                  studies investigated short-term associations between income
                  and SRH or the effect of temporary (usually one year) income
                  changes or shocks, so did not rule out possibly stronger
                  associations between health and longer-term average income or
                  income lagged over longer time periods. Nevertheless, the true
                  causal short-term relationship between income and health,
                  estimated by longitudinal studies of income change and SRH
                  that control for confounding, may be much smaller than that

                  income is not as simple as it may sound. It can be
                  conceptualized at the individual or the household level, with
                  the former better reflecting an individual's earning ability,
                  and the latter better capturing living standards. Furthermore,
                  respondents are often grouped into income categories based on
                  their positions in the income distribution, and this
                  operationalization can be done on the basis of age-specific or
                  total population income distributions. In this study, we look
                  at how four combinations of different conceptualizations
                  (individual vs. household) and operationalizations
                  (age-specific vs. total population) of income can affect
                  mortality inequality estimates. Using Finnish registry data,
                  we constructed period life tables for ages 25+ from 1996 to
                  2017 by gender and for four income definitions. The results
                  indicated that the slope index of inequality for life
                  expectancy varied by 1.1-5.7 years between income definitions,
                  with larger differences observed for women than for men. The
                  overall age patterns of relative index of inequality for
                  mortality rates yielded by the four definitions were similar,
                  but the levels differed. The period trends across income
                  definitions were consistent for men, but not for women. We
                  conclude that researchers should pay particular attention to
                  the choice of the income definitions when analyzing the
                  association between income and mortality, and when comparing
                  the magnitude of inequality across studies and over time.},

                  the issues of effect measure modification, interaction and
