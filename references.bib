                  disease (CHD) were everyone to quit smoking and start
                  exercising or to start exercising if diagnosed with
                  diabetes--may not be possible using standard analytic
                  techniques. The parametric g-formula, which appropriately
                  adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior
                  exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects
                  when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint
                  interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions
                  that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors
                  (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula,
                  and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical
                  lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the
                  Nurses' Health Study. Over the period 1982-2002, the 20-year
                  risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50\%. Under a joint
                  intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet,
                  moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the
                  estimated risk was 1.89\% (95\% confidence interval:
                  1.46-2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for
                  the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses'
                  Health Study data. This work represents the first large-scale

                  regimes. Like g-estimation of structural nested models and
                  inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models,
                  the parametric g-formula can appropriately adjust for measured
                  time-varying confounders that are affected by prior treatment.
                  However, there have been few implementations of the parametric
                  g-formula to date. Here, we apply the parametric g-formula to
                  assess the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy on
                  time to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death in
                  two US-based human immunodeficiency virus cohorts including
                  1498 participants. These participants contributed
                  approximately 7300 person-years of follow-up (49\% exposed to
                  highly active antiretroviral therapy) during which 382 events
                  occurred and 259 participants were censored because of
                  dropout. Using the parametric g-formula, we estimated that
                  antiretroviral therapy substantially reduces the hazard of
                  AIDS or death (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95\% confidence limits
                  [CL]: 0.42, 0.71). This estimate was similar to one previously
                  reported using a marginal structural model, 0.54 (95\% CL:
                  0.38, 0.78). The 6.5-year difference in risk of AIDS or death
                  was 13\% (95\% CL: 8\%, 18\%). Results were robust to
                  assumptions about temporal ordering, and extent of history
                  modeled, for time-varying covariates. The parametric g-formula
                  is a viable alternative to inverse probability weighting of
                  marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural
                  nested models for the analysis of complex longitudinal data.},

                  the effect of a policy, intervention, or treatment. Unlike
                  standard regression approaches, the parametric g-formula can
                  be used to adjust for time-varying confounders that are
                  affected by prior exposures. To date, there are few published
                  examples in which the method has been applied. METHODS: We
                  provide a simple introduction to the parametric g-formula and
                  illustrate its application in an analysis of a small cohort
                  study of bone marrow transplant patients in which the effect
                  of treatment on mortality is subject to time-varying
                  confounding. RESULTS: Standard regression adjustment yields a
                  biased estimate of the effect of treatment on mortality
                  relative to the estimate obtained by the g-formula.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The g-formula allows estimation of a relevant
                  parameter for public health officials: the change in the
                  hazard of mortality under a hypothetical intervention, such as
                  reduction of exposure to a harmful agent or introduction of a
                  beneficial new treatment. We present a simple approach to
                  implement the parametric g-formula that is sufficiently
                  general to allow easy adaptation to many settings of public
                  health relevance.},

                  periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not
                  uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of
                  subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality
                  studies date of termination of employment is both a
                  determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals
                  receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor
                  for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave
                  employment). When current risk factor status determines
                  subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure,
                  standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates
                  as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the
                  true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one
                  adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation
                  raises the question, which if any population parameters can be
                  given a causal interpretation in observational mortality
                  studies?In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the
                  identification and computation of causal parameters in
                  mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This
                  approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the
                  observational study is identified with a hypothetical
                  double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's
                  assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data
                  file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing
                  mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a
                  double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment
                  protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol
                  can still be estimated.We reanalyze the mortality experience
                  of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our
                  method and compare our results with those obtained using
                  standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic
                  exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard
                  methods fail to detect.},

                  exchangeability, positivity, and no misspecification of the
                  model used to estimate weights. In recent years, several
                  published estimates of the effect of time-varying exposures
                  have been based on weighted estimation of the parameters of
                  marginal structural models because, unlike standard
                  statistical methods, weighting can appropriately adjust for
                  measured time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure.
                  As an example, the authors describe the last three assumptions
                  using the change in viral load due to initiation of
                  antiretroviral therapy among 918 human immunodeficiency
                  virus-infected US men and women followed for a median of 5.8
                  years between 1996 and 2005. The authors describe possible
                  tradeoffs that an epidemiologist may encounter when attempting
                  to make inferences. For instance, a tradeoff between bias and
                  precision is illustrated as a function of the extent to which
                  confounding is controlled. Weight truncation is presented as
                  an informal and easily implemented method to deal with these
                  tradeoffs. Inverse probability weighting provides a powerful
                  methodological tool that may uncover causal effects of
                  exposures that are otherwise obscured. However, as with all
                  methods, diagnostics and sensitivity analyses are essential

                  Because with observational data one can never be sure that
                  either a missingness model or a complete data model is
                  correct, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is to find a
                  DR estimator. DR estimators, in contrast to standard
                  likelihood-based or (nonaugmented) inverse
                  probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances,
                  instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal

                  studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance
                  of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict. The

                  association between income and health, but estimates of the
                  causal effects of income vary substantially. Different
                  definitions of income may lead to substantially different
                  empirical results, yet research is often framed as
                  investigating "the effect of income" as if it were a single,
                  easily definable construct. METHODS/RESULTS: The aim of this
                  paper is to introduce a taxonomy for definitional and
                  conceptual issues in studying individual- or household-level
                  income for health research. We focus on (1) the definition of
                  the income measure (earned and unearned; net, gross, and
                  disposable; real and nominal; individual and household;
                  relative and absolute income) and (2) the definition of the
                  causal contrast (amount, functional form
                  assumptions/transformations, direction, duration of change,
                  and timing of exposure and follow-up). We illustrate the
                  application of the taxonomy to four examples from the
                  published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Quantified estimates of
                  causal effects of income on health and wellbeing have crucial
                  relevance for policymakers to anticipate the consequences of
                  policies targeting the social determinants of health. However,
                  much prior evidence has been limited by lack of clarity in
                  distinguishing between different causal questions. The present
                  framework can help researchers explicitly and precisely
                  articulate income-related exposures and causal questions.},

                  households do less well than their peers on a range of
                  developmental outcomes. However, there is continuing
                  uncertainty about how far money itself matters, and how far
                  associations simply reflect other, unobserved, differences
                  between richer and poorer families. The authors conducted a
                  systematic review of studies using methods that lend
                  themselves to causal interpretation. To be included, studies
                  had to use Randomised Controlled Trials, quasi-experiments or
                  fixed effect-style techniques on longitudinal data. The
                  results lend strong support to the hypothesis that household
                  income has a positive causal effect on children’s outcomes,
                  including their cognitive and social-behavioural development
                  and their health, particularly in households with low income
                  to begin with. There is also clear evidence of a positive
                  causal effect of income on ‘intermediate outcomes’ that are
                  important for children’s development, including maternal
                  mental health, parenting and the home environment. The review
                  also makes a methodological contribution, identifying that
                  effects tend to be larger in experimental and
                  quasi-experimental studies than in fixed effect approaches.
                  This finding has implications for our ability to generalise
                  from observational studies.},

                  health to income). This paper reports results of a systematic
                  review of panel and longitudinal studies investigating whether
                  changes in income led to changes in self-rated health (SRH) in
                  adults. A variety of electronic databases were searched, up
                  until January 2010, and thirteen studies were included, using
                  data from five different panel or longitudinal studies. The
                  majority of studies found a small, positive and statistically
                  significant association of income with SRH, which was much
                  reduced after controlling for unmeasured confounders and/or
                  health selection. Residual bias, particularly from measurement
                  error, probably reduced this association to the null. Most
                  studies investigated short-term associations between income
                  and SRH or the effect of temporary (usually one year) income
                  changes or shocks, so did not rule out possibly stronger
                  associations between health and longer-term average income or
                  income lagged over longer time periods. Nevertheless, the true
                  causal short-term relationship between income and health,
                  estimated by longitudinal studies of income change and SRH
                  that control for confounding, may be much smaller than that

                  income is not as simple as it may sound. It can be
                  conceptualized at the individual or the household level, with
                  the former better reflecting an individual's earning ability,
                  and the latter better capturing living standards. Furthermore,
                  respondents are often grouped into income categories based on
                  their positions in the income distribution, and this
                  operationalization can be done on the basis of age-specific or
                  total population income distributions. In this study, we look
                  at how four combinations of different conceptualizations
                  (individual vs. household) and operationalizations
                  (age-specific vs. total population) of income can affect
                  mortality inequality estimates. Using Finnish registry data,
                  we constructed period life tables for ages 25+ from 1996 to
                  2017 by gender and for four income definitions. The results
                  indicated that the slope index of inequality for life
                  expectancy varied by 1.1-5.7 years between income definitions,
                  with larger differences observed for women than for men. The
                  overall age patterns of relative index of inequality for
                  mortality rates yielded by the four definitions were similar,
                  but the levels differed. The period trends across income
                  definitions were consistent for men, but not for women. We
                  conclude that researchers should pay particular attention to
                  the choice of the income definitions when analyzing the
                  association between income and mortality, and when comparing
                  the magnitude of inequality across studies and over time.},

                  counterfactual theory of causation, the potential outcomes

                  the issues of effect measure modification, interaction and
                  mediation (direct and indirect effects). Third, we define the

                  exchangeability, positivity, consistency and non-interference.

                  global disease burden and the associated risk factors among
                  the population aged 70 and older across different regions.
                  METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD)
                  database were used to analyze global deaths,
                  disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and average annual
                  percentage changes to assess disease burden and associated
                  risk factors. RESULTS: In 2021, the global population aged 70
                  and older reached 494.4 (95\%UI 482.1-508.2) million. Death
                  and DALY rates have declined by 9.2\% (95\%CI 5.3-12.7) and
                  11.0\% (95\%CI 7.7-14.0) from 1990 to 2021, respectively.
                  However, the global death rate increased to 7,062 per 100,000
                  population, with DALY rates rising to 125,042 per 100,000. A
                  strong correlation exists between socio-demographic index
                  (SDI) and DALY rates. Regions with lower SDI levels,
                  particularly low and low-middle SDI regions, showed higher
                  DALY rates, reaching 189,563 and 165,080 per 100,000,
                  respectively. The leading causes of death among the older
                  included ischemic heart disease, stroke, COVID-19, and chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary risk factors
                  contributing to DALYs were high systolic blood pressure, air
                  pollution, and tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: The global disease
                  burden among adults aged 70 and older has shown declines in
                  death and DALY rates, yet remains a significant challenge
                  exacerbated by population growth, especially in less developed
                  regions. Implementing preventive strategies that target
                  primary risk factors early and enhancing treatment of
                  underlying conditions are crucial.},

                  complex patterns of disease and injury burden over time and
                  across age groups, sexes, and locations. The availability of
                  disease burden estimates can promote evidence-based
                  interventions that enable public health researchers, policy
                  makers, and other professionals to implement strategies that
                  can mitigate diseases. It can also facilitate more rigorous

                  health targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. For
                  three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and
                  Risk Factors Study (GBD) has filled that need. A global
                  network of collaborators contributed to the production of GBD
                  2021 by providing, reviewing, and analysing all available
                  data. GBD estimates are updated routinely with additional data
                  and refined analytical methods. GBD 2021 presents, for the
                  first time, estimates of health loss due to the COVID-19
                  pandemic. METHODS: The GBD 2021 disease and injury burden
                  analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years
                  of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs),
                  and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 371 diseases and
                  injuries using 100 983 data sources. Data were extracted from
                  vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, censuses,
                  household surveys, disease-specific registries, health service
                  contact data, and other sources. YLDs were calculated by
                  multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific prevalence of
                  sequelae by their respective disability weights, for each
                  disease and injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying
                  cause-age-sex-location-year-specific deaths by the standard
                  life expectancy at the age that death occurred. DALYs were
                  calculated by summing YLDs and YLLs. HALE estimates were
                  produced using YLDs per capita and age-specific mortality
                  rates by location, age, sex, year, and cause. 95\% uncertainty
                  intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the
                  2·5th and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws. Uncertainty
                  was propagated at each step of the estimation process. Counts
                  and age-standardised rates were calculated globally, for seven
                  super-regions, 21 regions, 204 countries and territories
                  (including 21 countries with subnational locations), and 811
                  subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021. Here we report data
                  for 2010 to 2021 to highlight trends in disease burden over
                  the past decade and through the first 2 years of the COVID-19
                  pandemic. FINDINGS: Global DALYs increased from 2·63 billion
                  (95\% UI 2·44-2·85) in 2010 to 2·88 billion (2·64-3·15) in
                  2021 for all causes combined. Much of this increase in the
                  number of DALYs was due to population growth and ageing, as
                  indicated by a decrease in global age-standardised all-cause
                  DALY rates of 14·2\% (95\% UI 10·7-17·3) between 2010 and
                  2019. Notably, however, this decrease in rates reversed during
                  the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increases in
                  global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates since 2019 of
                  4·1\% (1·8-6·3) in 2020 and 7·2\% (4·7-10·0) in 2021. In 2021,
                  COVID-19 was the leading cause of DALYs globally (212·0
                  million [198·0-234·5] DALYs), followed by ischaemic heart
                  disease (188·3 million [176·7-198·3]), neonatal disorders
                  (186·3 million [162·3-214·9]), and stroke (160·4 million
                  [148·0-171·7]). However, notable health gains were seen among
                  other leading communicable, maternal, neonatal, and
                  nutritional (CMNN) diseases. Globally between 2010 and 2021,
                  the age-standardised DALY rates for HIV/AIDS decreased by
                  47·8\% (43·3-51·7) and for diarrhoeal diseases decreased by
                  47·0\% (39·9-52·9). Non-communicable diseases contributed 1·73
                  billion (95\% UI 1·54-1·94) DALYs in 2021, with a decrease in
                  age-standardised DALY rates since 2010 of 6·4\% (95\% UI
                  3·5-9·5). Between 2010 and 2021, among the 25 leading Level 3
                  causes, age-standardised DALY rates increased most
                  substantially for anxiety disorders (16·7\% [14·0-19·8]),
                  depressive disorders (16·4\% [11·9-21·3]), and diabetes
                  (14·0\% [10·0-17·4]). Age-standardised DALY rates due to
                  injuries decreased globally by 24·0\% (20·7-27·2) between 2010
                  and 2021, although improvements were not uniform across
                  locations, ages, and sexes. Globally, HALE at birth improved
                  slightly, from 61·3 years (58·6-63·6) in 2010 to 62·2 years
                  (59·4-64·7) in 2021. However, despite this overall increase,
                  HALE decreased by 2·2\% (1·6-2·9) between 2019 and 2021.
                  INTERPRETATION: Putting the COVID-19 pandemic in the context
                  of a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of
                  causes of health loss is crucial to understanding its impact
                  and ensuring that health funding and policy address needs at
                  both local and global levels through cost-effective and
                  evidence-based interventions. A global epidemiological
                  transition remains underway. Our findings suggest that
                  prioritising non-communicable disease prevention and treatment
                  policies, as well as strengthening health systems, continues
                  to be crucially important. The progress on reducing the burden
                  of CMNN diseases must not stall; although global trends are
                  improving, the burden of CMNN diseases remains unacceptably
                  high. Evidence-based interventions will help save the lives of
                  young children and mothers and improve the overall health and
                  economic conditions of societies across the world. Governments
                  and multilateral organisations should prioritise pandemic
                  preparedness planning alongside efforts to reduce the burden
                  of diseases and injuries that will strain resources in the
                  coming decades. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The global older population has been rapidly
                  increasing in recent decades, presenting substantial economic
                  and social challenges. AIMS: This study aims to examine the
                  global disease burden and the associated risk factors among
                  the population aged 70 and older across different regions.
                  METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD)
                  database were used to analyze global deaths,
                  disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and average annual
                  percentage changes to assess disease burden and associated
                  risk factors. RESULTS: In 2021, the global population aged 70
                  and older reached 494.4 (95\%UI 482.1-508.2) million. Death
                  and DALY rates have declined by 9.2\% (95\%CI 5.3-12.7) and
                  11.0\% (95\%CI 7.7-14.0) from 1990 to 2021, respectively.
                  However, the global death rate increased to 7,062 per 100,000
                  population, with DALY rates rising to 125,042 per 100,000. A
                  strong correlation exists between socio-demographic index
                  (SDI) and DALY rates. Regions with lower SDI levels,
                  particularly low and low-middle SDI regions, showed higher
                  DALY rates, reaching 189,563 and 165,080 per 100,000,
                  respectively. The leading causes of death among the older
                  included ischemic heart disease, stroke, COVID-19, and chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary risk factors
                  contributing to DALYs were high systolic blood pressure, air
                  pollution, and tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: The global disease
                  burden among adults aged 70 and older has shown declines in
                  death and DALY rates, yet remains a significant challenge
                  exacerbated by population growth, especially in less developed
                  regions. Implementing preventive strategies that target
                  primary risk factors early and enhancing treatment of
                  underlying conditions are crucial.},

                  study must be able to answer the question: what is your
                  estimand? The estimand is the target quantity—the purpose of
                  the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on
                  how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given
                  to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that
                  authors state the central quantity of each analysis—the
                  theoretical estimand—in precise terms that exist outside of
                  any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three
                  things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting
                  this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand,
                  which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some
                  identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding
                  precise estimands to research practice expands the space of
                  theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to
                  those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By
                  grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target
                  quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to
                  theory.},

                  for estimating effect modification by evolving time-varying
                  covariates. Rather, structural nested models (SNMs) were
                  specifically designed to estimate effect modification by
                  time-varying covariates. In their paper, Petersen et al. (Am J
                  Epidemiol 2007;166:985-993) describe history-adjusted MSMs as
                  a generalized form of MSM and argue that history-adjusted MSMs
                  allow a researcher to easily estimate effect modification by
                  time-varying covariates. However, history-adjusted MSMs can
                  result in logically incompatible parameter estimates and hence
                  in contradictory substantive conclusions. Here the authors

                  than the one provided by Petersen et al. and compare the
