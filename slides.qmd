## What is poverty?

- People experience poverty when their resources are not enough to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare.
- It is estimated than as of 2025, ~1.7 million people are living in relative poverty in the UK (1 in 5 pensioners, 17%) [@CAB2025].

:::{.callout-note title = "Definitions of poverty in the UK [@Francis-Devine2025]"}
- **Relative low income:** People living in households with income below 60% of the median in that year.
- **Absolute low income:** People living in households with income below 60% of the median in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation.

:::{.callout-important title = "How we measure poverty?"}
  Poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond income and includes social, economic, and psychological aspects.

## The problem
How to estimate the causal effect of pensioner poverty on health outcomes?

### Why is this a problem?
- Socioeconomic conditions have been shown to be strong predictors of health outcomes [@Marmot2005-kx].
- There is evidence that income has an impact on health outcomes [@Gunasekara2011-fi; @Cooper2021-xh].

## Conditions for causal inference on observational studies [@hernan2025]
- **Consistency:** the values of treatment under comparison correspond to well-defined interventions.
- **Exchangeability:** the conditional probability of receiving every value of treatment depends only on measured covariates.
- **Positivity:** every subject has a non-zero probability of receiving every value of treatment.

## Challenges
:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Confounding:** Many variables are time-varying and affected by prior exposures.
- **Administrative data:** Reliance on administrative data may not capture all relevant confounders.
- **Definition of income [@Shi2021-ow]:** High heterogeneity in the definition of income (e.g., individual versus household level).
- **Definition of the causal contrast [@Igelstrom2022-vw]:** What we are comparing, i.e. which point of time? what measure of change?.

## Potential methods for handling these challenges
- **Marginal Structural Models (MSMs):** Use inverse probability weighting to create a pseudo-population where the treatment is independent of measured confounders.
- **Doubly Robust Estimation:** Combines outcome regression and propensity score weighting to provide consistent estimates if either model is correctly specified.
- **G-computation:** A method that involves modeling the outcome as a function of treatment and confounders, then averaging over the distribution of confounders.
