## What is Poverty?

People experience poverty when their resources are not enough to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare. \
Poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond income and includes social, economic, and psychological aspects.

- **Relative low income:** People living in households with income below 60% of the median in that year.
- **Absolute low income:** People living in households with income below 60% of the median in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation.

## Conditions for Causal Inference on observational studies
- **Consistency:** the values of treatment under comparison correspond to well-defined interventions
- **Exchangeability:** the conditional probability of receiving every value of treatment depends only on measured covariates
- **Positivity:** every subject has a non-zero probability of receiving every value of treatment
