## What is poverty?

- People experience poverty when their resources are not enough to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare.
- It is estimated than as of 2025, ~1.7 million people are living in relative poverty in the UK (1 in 5 pensioners, 17%) [@CAB2025].

:::{.callout-note title = "Definitions of poverty in the UK [@Francis-Devine2025]"}
- **Relative low income:** People living in households with income below 60% of the median in that year.
- **Absolute low income:** People living in households with income below 60% of the median in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation.

:::{.callout-important title = "How we measure poverty?"}
  Poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond income and includes social, economic, and psychological aspects.

## The problem
How to estimate the causal effect of interventions on pensioner poverty over health outcomes?

### Why is this a problem?
- Socioeconomic conditions have been shown to be strong predictors of health outcomes [@Marmot2005-kx].
- There is evidence that income has an impact on health outcomes [@Gunasekara2011-fi; @Cooper2021-xh].
- However, much of the variables while ascertaining this problem are time-varying affected by prior exposures.
- Another problem is the reliance on administrative data, which may not capture all relevant confounders.

## Conditions for causal inference on observational studies [@hernan2025]
- **Consistency:** the values of treatment under comparison correspond to well-defined interventions.
- **Exchangeability:** the conditional probability of receiving every value of treatment depends only on measured covariates.
- **Positivity:** every subject has a non-zero probability of receiving every value of treatment.
